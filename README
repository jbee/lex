IMPLEMENTAIONS

Java: basic ~100 LOC, optimized ~150 LOC


________________________________________________________________________________

SETS         {...}, }...{

{abc}        a set of bytes "a","b" and "c"
{^abc}       a set of any byte but "a","b" and "c"
{a-c}:       a set of "a", "b" and "c" given as a range
}a-c{:       range of "a" to "c" and *all* non ASCII bytes


SPECIAL SETS

# = {0-9}    any ASCII digit
@ = {a-zA-Z} any ASCII letter
_            any ASCII whitespace character
^            any byte that is not a ASCII whitespace character
! = }{       any non ASCII byte (1xxx xxxx)
*            any single byte
$            ASCII new line (\n or \r)


REPETITION   x+

+            try previous set, group or literal again


GROUPS       (...), [...]

(abc)        a group with sequence "abc" that *must* occur
[abc]        a group with sequence "abc" that *can* occur


SCANNING     ~x

~            skip until following set, group or literal matches


Any other byte (not {}()[]#@^_$+~!*) is matched literally. 
Sets can be used to match any of the instruction symbols literally, like {~}.

EXAMPLES

####/##/##        a date of format yyyy/mm/dd
##:##[:##]        a time of format hh:mm or hh:mm:ss
#+[.#+]           a simple floating point number with optional decimals
"{^"}+"           a quoted string using a set to find the end
"~"               a quoted string using a scan to find the end
"~({^\}")         a quoted string using a scan with escaping support
{$}@}a-zA-Z0-9_{  a php style identifier
[{+}]#+[{ -}#+]+  international phone numbers
~(Foo)            searching for "Foo" (e.g. in a file)
~(<h#>)           searching for "<h0>" to "<h9>"
~(<h{1-6}>)       searching for "<h1>" to "<h6>"
